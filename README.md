# react-native-maps Heatmap Example

This is a brand new React Native project that has installed the Heatmaps pull request via  
`npm install https://github.com/airbnb/react-native-maps#pull/1549/head --save`

## To run the project you can simply:

1. `npm install`
2. `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`

You should then see a heatmap on either iOS Apple Maps or Android Google Maps.
